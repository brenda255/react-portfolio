      <p>
      Hey! I’m a graduate of the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp, where I got hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and full-stack development.<br />

      <br />What I loved most about the program was building real projects and learning how everything connects—from the front-end design to back-end logic. I’m still learning every day, and that’s honestly my favorite part about being in tech—there’s always something new to explore.<br />

      <br />I'm excited to grow as a developer, build cool stuff with great people, and contribute wherever I can. Thanks for checking out my work!<br />
      </p>
