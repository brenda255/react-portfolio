      <p>
      Hey there! I graduated from the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp in April 2023 and I'm excited to jump into the tech scene. During the length of the course we learned skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provided me with the essential skills to become a Full-Stack Web Developer.

      <br />Since I know the tech world is always changing, I'm up for learning and growing as I go. Can't wait to work on some awesome projects and be a part of this community! <br />
